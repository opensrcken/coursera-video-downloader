This auto-names video files from any site and downloads them. It was built with Coursera in mind,
where some class's videos download with the name `index.mp4` instead of matching the title of the
video to which they are attached. Manually naming them is very annoying.

1) Run the server: server.js
2) Run `in-browser-code.js` in Chrome dev tools. This code should parse the section and name of the video from the site, and hit the endpoint provided by server.js.

This code is subject to change, depending on the version of JS code Coursera is running.
